# Development Log
A reverse-chronological log of significant development activities, decisions, and findings.

## Template for New Entries

```markdown

*   **Summary:** A concise, one-sentence summary of the activity and its outcome.
*   **Details:**
    *   (Provide a more detailed narrative here. Use bullet points for clarity.)
*   **Outcome:**
    *   (What is the new state of the project after this activity? What was the result?)

*   **Date:** 2025-07-11
*   **Author(s):** Benjamin Pequet
*   **Type:** Task
*   **Summary:** Refined the main script by replacing `dd` with `brctl download`, refactoring utility functions, updating documentation, and adding example output.
*   **Details:**
    *   Replaced the "force-read" (`dd`) mechanism with a more direct `brctl download` command for forcing files to become local, which is a more stable and explicit method.
    *   Refactored the script to move shared functions into `scripts/utils/logging_utils.sh` and `scripts/utils/messaging_utils.sh` for better organization.
    *   Updated all Memory Bank documentation to reflect the new `brctl` implementation and the latest project status.
    *   Added `scripts/EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.txt` to show users what to expect when running the script.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The script is more robust and maintainable, and the project documentation is up-to-date with the latest implementation.
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `scripts/dls-check-icloud-files.sh`
    *   `scripts/utils/logging_utils.sh`
    *   `scripts/utils/messaging_utils.sh`
    *   `memory-bank/`

*   **Type:** Decision
*   **Summary:** Pivoted project from unreliable file status detection to an enforcement strategy using a "force-read" pattern after research confirmed OS limitations.
*   **Details:**
    *   Initiated investigation into why the original `dls-check-icloud-files.sh` script failed to detect cloud-only files.
    *   Performed extensive command-line diagnostics using `xattr`, `brctl`, and `mdfind`, which all proved unreliable for *detection*.
    *   Used `vibe-tools web` to confirm that there is no reliable shell-based method to check iCloud file download status on modern macOS, which is a known OS limitation.
    *   Pivoted the project strategy from "detection" to "enforcement."
    *   Archived the original detection-only script to `archives/scripts/`.
    *   Developed a new `dls-check-icloud-files.sh` (v2.0) that implements the "force-read" (`dd`) pattern to ensure all files become local.
    *   Added an interactive confirmation step to the new script to improve safety and user control.
    *   Populated the entire project Memory Bank (`project-brief.md`, `product-context.md`, etc.) to document the new project direction, technical findings, and journey.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The project now focuses on ensuring files are local rather than just checking their status, with a new, functional script and updated documentation reflecting this strategic pivot.
