## Current Focus: Project Finalization & Documentation Sync

The core script is finalized and has been refactored. The immediate focus is ensuring all project documentation is synchronized with the latest version of the script and repository state.

### Next Actions:

1.  **Memory Bank Review (In Progress):** Sequentially review every file in the `memory-bank/` directory to ensure they accurately reflect the script's final implementation (`brctl download`), refactoring (utility scripts), and overall project status.
2.  **Final `README.md` Polish:** Perform a final read-through of the main `README.md` to ensure all instructions and descriptions are clear and accurate.
3.  **General Cleanup:** Review the repository for any other remaining boilerplate files or artifacts that should be removed or updated before the initial public release.
