# Development Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-11

## Current State

The primary script (`scripts/dls-check-icloud-files.sh`) is feature-complete and stable.

*   **Core Logic:** The script uses the `brctl download` command to reliably force iCloud files to become fully available on the local machine. This is a more direct and robust method than the previous "force-read" approach.
*   **Refactoring:** The script has been refactored for clarity and maintainability, with shared functions for logging and messaging moved to `scripts/utils/`.
*   **Documentation:** The project's Memory Bank has been updated to reflect the final script architecture. The main `README.md` is complete.

The project is considered stable and ready for initial release.

## Next Steps

1.  **Final Review:** Perform a final check of all files to ensure there is no remaining boilerplate or outdated information.
2.  **Publish:** The repository is ready to be published or pushed to its public remote.
